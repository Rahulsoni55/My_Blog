            launching, and managing a product or service. It includes the entire lifecycle of a product,
            from ideation to development to go to market. Product managers are responsible for ensuring that a
            product meets the needs of its target market and contributes to the business strategy, while managing a
            product or products at
            all stages of the product lifecycle. Software product management adapts the fundamentals of product

            Product managers are responsible for managing a company's product line on a day-to-day basis. As a result,
            product managers are critical in both driving a company's growth,
            margins, and revenue. They are responsible for the business case, conceptualizing, planning, product
            development, product marketing, and delivering products to their target market. Depending
            on the company size, industry, and history, product management has a variety of functions and roles.
            Frequently there is Profit and Loss (P&L) responsibility as a key metric for evaluating product manager
            performance.
